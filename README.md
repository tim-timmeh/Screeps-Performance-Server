a. Change `STEAM_API_KEY` to your key
b. If you want to auto login to one of the users you can change one of the USER Steam ids to yours and choose an room in `config.js`
c. If you want to use the milestone result export integration then you need to possible update the `EXPORT_URL` to your bot api endpoint.

2. Add your js bot to an folder inside the `bots` folder. Then update the `config.example.yml` your code and an `main.js` file should ben in the folder `dist`

## HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADD CLI COMMANDS. Below works
echo "system.resumeSimulation()" | curl -X POST -H "content-type:text/plain" -d @- http://localhost:21026/cli
